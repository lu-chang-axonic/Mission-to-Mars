# Mission-to-Mars

For deliverable 3:
*Added container-fluid to make the website responsive. After resizing the browser, I confirmed that the website was responsive. Tables adjust themselves by repositioning to the size of the browser.

*Customized the "Scrape New Data" Button by adding "btn-block" and changed color from blue to muddy blue by replacing "btn-primary" with "btn-info".

* Changed the font of "Mars-facts" from h4 to h2 to match that of the the Mars Featured Image title.
